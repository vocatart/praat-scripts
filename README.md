# praat-scripts

various things i use for development

- articulation-generate: split up a two-tiered textgrid based on a phoneme tier and an articulation tier. i originally made this a few years ago by tweaking someone elses script to do some extra things, but i cannot find it anymore so. oops.
- pmpitch: quick and dirty parselmouth pitch extraction.
